# Hello Microverse

> In this project, I am setting up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. My goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I've learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in the future job as well, so it is important to know them!
